# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Retail Shift Management System**

Project Author: **William Papps**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

A Retail Business needs to be able to have a simple system that allow's them to see their employee's shifts and manage them.

### End-User Requirements

The Retail Shift Managers and employees. These users will be workers, but also involved in what time they work. The clients want a  way to see and manage the shifts that their employees will be working so that they can prepare for the amount of work that will be done and need to be done as well as give new employees shift's in time's where they need more. They might do this via a mobile device, or a computer. Their IT skills could be weak, so they should be able to use my system without any training. They will likely want the site to have styling related to easy to understand and easy to use. The managers will be able to have some training to use the system, but even then the system should still be easy to use. They will mostly be using the system via the business computer. They will want the site to be very easy to use and straightforward and able to present the data cleanly. In terms of styling they could have it matching their style of business.

### Proposed Solution

A website for the Retail Business that allows the business manager to view employees shifts with editable data to manage when people are working. The website will also allow the manager to select certain employee's and edit when they're working.

Client should be able to

- View assigned shifts
- View others assigned Shifts

Managers should be able to 
-View employee's assigned shifts
-Edit and Manage employee's assigned shifts
-add new employee

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how easy it is for the ender-use to use, without them needing any help or guidance while using it.The usability can be measured using Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.

The usability implication is relevant to my retail project because every employee who wants to use the item will not be getting trained on how to use the website as there is too many people in the retail industry coming and going between jobs for example PAK'nSAVE has lots of students come and go every year and lots in the holidays. It is important that they're all able to use this resource without needing guidance so retail stores don't have to spend there time teaching each new individual.It is also important that the managers are able to use the resource with little to no help because it is very important for them to be able to easily change and mange their workers shifts.I need to ensure that every body in the retail industry is capable of using my resource even if they're not very good with using IT.

When developing my website I will need to consider using Nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as much as possible. Specifically, I will aim for a very clan and modern interface with a minimalistic design so there isn't to much to get overcomplicated with. The UI should be very basic and intuitive to use. Users should be able to easily see what shifts they are working or managers should easily be able to see there shifts and edit them. I will test my UI with my users and obtain feedback which will allow me to refine my design.

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how well it works for there end-user, in terms of does the resource/website meet the intended purpose and solve the user's need.

I will need to design my system to be as functional as possible since the clients of the retail stores will need my website to solve their problem/need of changing employee's shifts easily it needs to meet this purpose in order to be  a functional website and have no bugs as having bugs in the system could really screw up and interfere with the business and potentially mean that  nobody worked on one day due to a website bug. The website should work as expected from the users point of view it should have no hidden items that they're unaware of and should be straight forward.

As I create my system I will need to make sure that website is going to and does satisfy the original purpose/need for making it. I will aim for a very straight forward website that only solve's the purpose/need and doesn't have any unnecessary items to make the website feel chunky. I will aim to have the user's requirements met to the best that is possible. I will make sure that the system is able to cope with all inputs such as abnormal, normal and boundary I will make sure there is no errors for the user that will disturb there time using the website.

### Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome involve ensuring it is available and can be used by every end-user possible regardless of their limitations.

Replace this text with an explanation of why the implication is relevant to this particular project.

I will need to design my system to be as accessible as possible since the end-users will need my website this is relevant because there cant be people with impairments or limitations that means that they're unable to use the website. Every worker in the retail store needs access and able to use the website. The website should work as expected on any device of the end-users it should have no problems with using different devices.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

As i design my website I will make sure that the colour and tone I combine will have good levels of contrast to help in accessing texts/icons/graphics I will make sure that the different colours used will not hurt anybody's eyes and will not make the website difficult to use if they're colour blind. I will have to make sure that the font and font size are readable as we don't want a too fancy font or too small font that some people are unable to read the words. The font will be straight forwards

## Review and Evaluation

### Meeting the Needs of the Users

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the needs of your users. Look at what you initially wrote about who they are, what specific needs they have, etc. and discuss how well the system meets those needs.

### Meeting the System Requirements

Replace this text with a brief evaluation of how well you met the requirements that you defined at the start of the project, etc. Look back at the list of features / functionality you initially set and discuss how well your system has implemented each one.
