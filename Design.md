# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Retail Shift Management System**

Project Author: **William Papps**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

A Retail Business needs to be able to have a simple system that allow's them to see their employee's shifts and manage them.

### End-User Requirements

The Retail Shift Managers and employees. These users will be workers, but also involved in what time they work. The clients want a  way to see and manage the shifts that their employees will be working so that they can prepare for the amount of work that will be done and need to be done as well as give new employees shift's in time's where they need more. They might do this via a mobile device, or a computer. Their IT skills could be weak, so they should be able to use my system without any training. They will likely want the site to have styling related to easy to understand and easy to use. The managers will be able to have some training to use the system, but even then the system should still be easy to use. They will mostly be using the system via the business computer. They will want the site to be very easy to use and straightforward and able to present the data cleanly. In terms of styling they could have it matching their style of business.

### Proposed Solution

A website for the Retail Business that allows the business manager to view employees shifts with editable data to manage when people are working. The website will also allow the manager to select certain employee's and edit when they're working.

Client should be able to

- View assigned shifts
- View others assigned Shifts

Managers should be able to 
-View employee's assigned shifts
-Edit and Manage employee's assigned shifts
-add new employee
