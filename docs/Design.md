# The Design of a Database-Driven Web Application for NCEA Level 3

Project Name: **Retail Shift Management System**

Project Author: **William Papps**

Assessment Standards: **91902** and **91903**


-------------------------------------------------

## System Requirements

### Identified Need or Problem

A Retail Business needs to be able to have a simple system that allow's them to see their employee's shifts and manage them.

### End-User Requirements

The Retail Shift Managers and employees. These users will be workers, but also involved in what time they work. The clients want a  way to see and manage the shifts that their employees will be working so that they can prepare for the amount of work that will be done and need to be done as well as give new employees shift's in time's where they need more. They might do this via a mobile device, or a computer. Their IT skills could be weak, so they should be able to use my system without any training. They will likely want the site to have styling related to easy to understand and easy to use. The managers will be able to have some training to use the system, but even then the system should still be easy to use. They will mostly be using the system via the business computer. They will want the site to be very easy to use and straightforward and able to present the data cleanly. In terms of styling they could have it matching their style of business.

### Proposed Solution

A website for the Retail Business that allows the business manager to view employees shifts with editable data to manage when people are working. The website will also allow the manager to select certain employee's and edit when they're working.

Client should be able to

- View assigned shifts
- View others assigned Shifts

Managers should be able to 
- View employee's assigned shifts
- Edit and Manage employee's assigned shifts
- add new employees

## Relevant Implications

### Usability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how easy it is for the ender-use to use, without them needing any help or guidance while using it.The usability can be measured using Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics.

The usability implication is relevant to my retail project because every employee who wants to use the item will not be getting trained on how to use the website as there is too many people in the retail industry coming and going between jobs for example PAK'nSAVE has lots of students come and go every year and lots in the holidays. It is important that they're all able to use this resource without needing guidance so retail stores don't have to spend there time teaching each new individual.It is also important that the managers are able to use the resource with little to no help because it is very important for them to be able to easily change and mange their workers shifts.I need to ensure that every body in the retail industry is capable of using my resource even if they're not very good with using IT.

When developing my website I will need to consider using Nielsen's heuristics and try to make sure that the UI meets them as much as possible. Specifically, I will aim for a very clan and modern interface with a minimalistic design so there isn't to much to get overcomplicated with. The UI should be very basic and intuitive to use. Users should be able to easily see what shifts they are working or managers should easily be able to see there shifts and edit them. I will test my UI with my users and obtain feedback which will allow me to refine my design.

### Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome relate to how well it works for there end-user, in terms of does the resource/website meet the intended purpose and solve the user's need.

I will need to design my system to be as functional as possible since the clients of the retail stores will need my website to solve their problem/need of changing employee's shifts easily it needs to meet this purpose in order to be  a functional website and have no bugs as having bugs in the system could really screw up and interfere with the business and potentially mean that  nobody worked on one day due to a website bug. The website should work as expected from the users point of view it should have no hidden items that they're unaware of and should be straight forward.

As I create my system I will need to make sure that website is going to and does satisfy the original purpose/need for making it. I will aim for a very straight forward website that only solve's the purpose/need and doesn't have any unnecessary items to make the website feel chunky. I will aim to have the user's requirements met to the best that is possible. I will make sure that the system is able to cope with all inputs such as abnormal, normal and boundary I will make sure there is no errors for the user that will disturb there time using the website.

### Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome involve ensuring it is available and can be used by every end-user possible regardless of their limitations.

Replace this text with an explanation of why the implication is relevant to this particular project.

I will need to design my system to be as accessible as possible since the end-users will need my website this is relevant because there cant be people with impairments or limitations that means that they're unable to use the website. Every worker in the retail store needs access and able to use the website. The website should work as expected on any device of the end-users it should have no problems with using different devices.

Replace this text with an explanation of what you will need to consider moving forward and how the project will be impacted by this implication.

As i design my website I will make sure that the colour and tone I combine will have good levels of contrast to help in accessing texts/icons/graphics I will make sure that the different colours used will not hurt anybody's eyes and will not make the website difficult to use if they're colour blind. I will have to make sure that the font and font size are readable as we don't want a too fancy font or too small font that some people are unable to read the words. The font will be straight forwards



-------------------------------------------------

## Relevant User Experience (UX) Principles

### Useful

Products and systems should be genuinely useful and fulfil a real need/purpose for the desired end-users.


If the website doesn't make it easy for clients to view a list of its employee's and their scheduled shifts, or if the site isn't easy to use and requires help, then it is clearly not a very useful site, and will most likely frustrate users. Frustrated users won't bother using the system and will revert to there older system or the one they're familiar with.


Right from the offset I will need to consult with my ender users to establish what they need from the system, and then make sure my design meets these needs. I need to extensively test the system with all the end users that will be using the system and get feedback about their experiences. Based towards their feedback I can judge whether they find the system useful or not and alter what needs to be changed to the system accordingly.

### Findable


Systems should be able to be easily navigated, so that end-users can find the content and complete tasks with the functionality and easiness they need and deserve.


Since the clients of the Retail business could potentially have no It skills this means that the system must be as simple to navigate as possible, with every function as clear as possible and findable.


I will need to consider how easily my system is to navigate in. I will need to make sure that my project will allow any end-user no matter what their skill level on IT is able to easily find and navigate through my website with minimal to no assistance This will impact my project by making sure there are no dead ends within the page and everything links together and you don't get stuck on a page. I can judge whether they find the system easily navigable based on their feedback and whether or not it needs to be changed.



### Valuable


The UX design principle Valuable means that it should be able to deliver value towards the business or organisation they represent. This could be monetary value, increased user engagement or saving there time.

The principle valuable is relevant to my project because the mangers of the retail stores need to be able to quickly change there employee's shifts and it needs to take as little amount of time possible.


During my project I will need to consider moving forward how much value the project actually provides which will mostly be looked at how much time the user spends using the website finding and doing what they need. I need to make sure that the end-user is able to change the employee's shifts/data as fast as possible to make it so they can save as much of their time as possible and spend it else where to better of their business. I can judge whether they find the system valuable as to how much time they spend doing their tasks.
